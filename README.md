# This reposistory is for deploying fastai (v2) neural networks (pkl files) onto the cloud service Render. For Fastaiv1 deployment see link below.

Forked from https://github.com/render-examples/fastai-v3

CHANGES: The deployment in original was designed for fastaiv1 and neural nets trained in fastai (v2) would not deploy. Outdated functions for loading neural networks (pkl files) changed for new ones.
Additionally loosened library version requirements to not conflict with fastai (v2)
